# College Selection Optimization

## Requirements

**Dependencies**

To install all required dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.xt
```

## Running the Program

The three algorithms are contained within three Jupyter Notebooks. If you would like to rerun them, restart the kernel and run all of the cells.

*Note:* The optimal stopping algorithm takes a while to run, so I would avoid rerunning the notebook or decrease the number of experiments.
